         * The ConsoleBoardRenderer writes to the console, which is not easily tested.
         * To fix this, redirect the Console output to a StringWriter.
         * Then you can verify the contents using ToString(). This is shown below.
         * This won't check colors, but it will check contents, which is good enough :)

         * var sw = new StringWriter();

         * // act
         * Console.SetOut(sw); // this redirects the output of all Console.Writes to the StringWriter
         * Console.WriteLine(str); // this is where you would call BoardRenderer.Render(board);
         * 
         * // assert
         * Assert.AreEqual(str, sw.ToString()); // this verifies the board rendered correctly
